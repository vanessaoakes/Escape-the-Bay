    "** The only data cleaning done was to add (for out-of-state),  Travis County TX, (Austin is located there),  which was added manually to the \"non_CA_counties.csv\" files\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Import the csv\n",
    "*  Method: pd.read_csv\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Clean up the data\n",
    "* Reduce the data size and clean up the naming (for easier reference later on)\n",
    "\n",
    "* df.drop()-    Drop columns all the columns which have no important data\n",
    "* df.dropna() - Drop rows with NaN\n",
    "* df.reset_index() - Reset the index because we had dropped out a few rows\n",
    "* df[:x] - Drop rows, only keep x rows\n",
    "* df.rename()  - Rename the colums with shorter names so the plots look ok\n",

    "3.2      Transform the data.  Because of the %, $ the data inside the dataframe are all read in as objects\n",
    "*   Doing it this way will clean the entire table, and the user can specify different facts to be used\n",
    "     \n",
    "*    df.set_index  - Move the \"Fact\" column into the index. That way the rest of the data will be cleaned of strings\n",
    "*    df.replace    - Replace the %, $, ,  in the data to blank\n",
    "*    df.apply(pd.to_numeric()) -- now change the objects in each column into numerics, \"apply\"  will apply to all cols\n",
